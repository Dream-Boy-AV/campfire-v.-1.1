Welcome to the "campfire" project!

"campfire" is a match-3 game, running on Pygame, using original textures and icons, also equiping lo-fi genre background songs by Chillhop. 

Game level interface includes:
a) mission display with the timer
b) "hint" and "pause" buttons
c) randomly generated field completed with cells including chips of 5 different types:
	1) Red tent
	2) Yellow campfire
	3) Green leaf
	4) Blue axe
	5) Black coal (only mode 3)

Match 3 or more identical figures on the field to complete the mission. When the mission is complete, you will finish the level.
But if the timer runs out, you lose.
Use the hint button in a tough situation and the pause button to pause the game.

"campfire" meets you with a cozy main menu and main theme of the game on the background.
In the menu you can see the brief set of game rules in the "Help" menu, set wanted options (upcoming in the next updates), start a new game,
contune the saved game and quit, using respective menu buttons. 

There are 3 different game modes, replacing each other every single level.

1) Match the required type chips to complete the level
2) Match the chips to open all the cells to complete the level
3) Match all the black chips to complete the level

This game contains 14 unique level patterns.

With the upcoming updates there might be more new level patterns, chip types and even game modes to come!

This game is supposed to transfer warmth and comfort and it's designed with this exact purpose.
I hope, this game will cope with this task.
Have fun!
